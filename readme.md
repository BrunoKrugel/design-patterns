# Design Patterns

## Builder

The Builder pattern allows the construction of a complex object by specifying the type and content only. Construction details are hidden from the client entirely.

## Decorator

The Decorator pattern extends (decorates) an object’s behavior dynamically. The ability to add new behavior at runtime is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’ around the original object. Multiple decorators can add or override functionality to the original object.

## Singleton

The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.

## Prototype

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with values it copied from a prototype - or example - object. The Prototype pattern is also referred to as the Properties pattern.
