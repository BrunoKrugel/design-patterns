# Design Patterns

## Builder

The Builder pattern allows the construction of a complex object by specifying the type and content only. Construction details are hidden from the creator.

## Decorator

The Decorator pattern extends an object’s behavior dynamically. The ability to add new behavior at runtime is accomplished by a Decorator object which ‘wraps itself’ around the original object.

## Singleton

The Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one.

## Prototype

The Prototype Pattern creates new objects, but rather than creating non-initialized objects it returns objects that are initialized with values it copied from a prototype.

## Abstract Factory

An Abstract Factory has an abstracted theme which is shared by the newly created objects.
